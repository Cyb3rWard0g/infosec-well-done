	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I am a threat researcher and I like to work on open source projects. However, I usually do not have much time to cook. Therefore, I wanted to share some of my favorite quick recipes and aggregate other ones from the infosec community to help anyone that might want to cook something different and quickly while working from 🏠.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Lima, Peru and first learned to cook from my parents when I was 16. After that, I lived on my own for almost 10 years, and I needed to survive without eating 🍔🍟 every day. I started with a red notebook that my mom gave to me with 3 recipes. Nowadays, I have more than 20 recipes thanks to my parents, wife and father-in-law 💖. I am slowly cleaning all the recipes and sharing the ones I believe are quick and help me to keep up timewise ⌛ with my open source development. I would love to also hear your quick recipes and add them to this project. Feel free to submit a PR to the GitHub Link: https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/infosec-well-done </p>
