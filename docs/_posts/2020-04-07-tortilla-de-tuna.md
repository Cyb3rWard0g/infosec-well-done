    1. If you want to serve this with white rice, start cooking the white rice now if you have not done it yet.
    2. Add all ingredients to a large bowl and stir for 2 minutes.
    3. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in a pan at low-medium heat.
    4. Take 1/2 cup of the mix from the large bowl and add it to the pan. Cook it as if you were frying an egg (both sides). Once it is done, move it to your serving plate.
    5. Repeat steps number 4-5 at least two more time or until the mix is gone.
    7. Serve with white rice or boil potatoes.
