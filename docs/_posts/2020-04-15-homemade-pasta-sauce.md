  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Peel the onions and garlic
    2. Blend or chop the onions and garlic
    3. Rinse and blend or chop tomato into diced size, for texture (this is used instead of canned diced tomatoes)
    4. Pour olive oil into pan. Cover 1/3 of the pan
    5. Bring the stove to medium high heat
    6. Sautee the onions and garlic until golden/light brown
    7. Pour the tomato sauce into the pan
    8. Bring the stove to low heat
    9. Put the sugar, salt, chopped tomato, pepper, onion powder, garic powder, oregano, and parsley into the pan
    10. Pour the water into the pan
    11. Put the cut up tomato into the pan
    12. Now that all ingredients are into the pan, bring the heat back to medium / high. So that the sauce will begin to boil
    13. Once it boils bring it down so it does not boil over
    13. Stir for 5 minutes while it is boiling, this is most important as this is when all the ingredients cook in together
    14. Bring the stove down to low
    15. Stir, for 15 seconds, every 5 minutes for the first 30. Do not worry if it does not taste right for the first 2 hours, the longer it cooks the more the ingredients mix 
    16. Stir, for 15 seconds, every 10-15 minutes for the next 3 hours
