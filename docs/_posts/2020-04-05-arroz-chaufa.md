    1. Start cooking the white rice if you have not done it yet.
    2. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a pan at medium heat.
    3. Add the hot dog to the pan and fry it for 2-4 minutes.
    4. Add the scrambled eggs to the pan with the hot dog and fry them for 2-4 minutes.
    5. Take the hot dogs and scrambled eggs and put them into a bowl (we will use them later).
    6. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the same pan at low heat.
    7. Add the minced garlic and freshly grated ginger and sautee them for 1/2 minute (Control the heat so that it does not burn right away)
    8. Add diced onions to the pan and fry them a little bit for another 4-5 minutes (gradually increase heat to medium)
    9. Once your white rice is ready, put it in a separate large bowl.
    10. Add 1 cup of cooked white rice, some scrambled eggs, hot dogs and scallions to the pan where the onions, garlic and ginger are cooking.
    11. Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce to the mix (to taste).
    12. Sautee everything at low-medium heat for 1 minute.
    13. Repeat steps 10-12 for another 3 times or until everything from all the bowls is gone (rice, scrambled eggs, hot dogs and scallions).
    14. Serve on a bowl ;)
